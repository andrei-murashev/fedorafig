--- Currently, you can only add one of each subkey to each entry. There should
    be an option to specify multiple packages, syspaths, and scripts. Multiple
    packages because you might want to group them if you are installing all of
    them for one particular purpose. Multiple syspaths to copy the configs
    into multiple directories if needed. Multiple scripts, for the same reason
    as multiple packages per entry.

STATUS: Resolved. Not applied.
--- Multiple copy paths
    Paths should come in pairs and pairs of list. There will be subentries `copy`
    for just pairs and `copy-many` for a pair of lists.
